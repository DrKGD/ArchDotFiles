- There is a minor bug regarding the toggle workspaces
	Trying to move them outside of the screen (does not succeed) will invalidate
		them tags, thus won't be able to reconnect onto them on workspace-switching
- More widgets and bars
		- Add a clock, a power-menu, applications on current tag
		- Home-set widgets such as cpu usage, ram usage, ethernet usage, battery graph (if possible)
- Set master_fill_policy to master_width_factor and align to right/left
- Add toggle as an extra client in the formula for workspace.alter
